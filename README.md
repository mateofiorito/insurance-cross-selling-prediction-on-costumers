What is cross-selling?
Cross-selling involves selling additional, related, or different types of insurance to customers who already have a policy. This involves offering different types of insurance coverage to meet different customer needs. For example, if a customer has a home insurance policy, a cross-selling opportunity might involve offering auto insurance or life insurance policies. Different types of insurance address separate aspects of the customerâ€™s financial security. 
Cross-selling thus aims to expand the breadth of insurance coverage across different product categories.
For the Insurance company, cross-seeling increases revenue by increasing sales of existing customers, and it triggers virtuous loyalty processes by improving overall satisfaction with the shopping experience
